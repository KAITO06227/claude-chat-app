# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Claude Code workspace directory containing only Claude configuration files. The project appears to be a fresh initialization with no actual codebase yet.

## Project Structure

```
.claude/
├── settings.local.json  # Claude permissions configuration
```

## Configuration

The project uses Claude Code's local settings to configure permissions for bash commands (`find` and `ls` operations are currently allowed).

## Development Setup

This is an empty workspace ready for project initialization. No specific build tools, dependencies, or development commands are configured yet.
